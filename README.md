This program was made in order to reduce the time it takes to reformat a given spreadsheet, saving a company hundreds of hours a year in regards to payroll and essentially automating this job.

A normal excel spreadsheet take roughly one to three days to complete which would cost the company a few hundred dollars although this program is to complete that task in less than a second.

For this program, I used libraries such as xlrd and xlsxwriter in order to interpret and manipulate the data within the spreadsheet. Both of these libraries are heavily documented and you should be able to find answers to all your questions online.

If anyone needs help regarding manipulating data, feel free to contact me via email at Jeremy.Herrmann@stonybrook.edu
